Description: Implements post-stratified estimation of complier average causal effects
    (CACE) in the presence of non-compliance for RCTs.  Package also provides some code to run simulations
    of different ways of estimating complier average causal effects, including 2SLS, 
    post-stratification, and various weighting approaches as delineated in our paper.
